       <h3 style="text-align:center;">Marketing the Crown of the Continent</h3>
       <p>Established in 1910, Glacier National Park is home to an abundance of scenery, wildlife, and opportunity to explore.</p>
       <p>Despite everything that Glacier has to offer, one of the park’s primary marketing challenges is the spotlight on retreating glaciers.</p>

         <h3 style="text-align:center;">Glacier's Greatest Marketing Challenge</h3>
           <p>Due largely to increasing climate temperatures and greenhouse gasses over the last century, only 25 of the original 150 glaciers remain, and scientists predict that they will be gone completely by 2030.</p>
           <p>The fear is that visitors are under the impression that there will be nothing left to see, and they will disappear along with the glaciers.</p>
           <p>This is important not only from a marketing standpoint but also because it represents a major economic and environmental concern.</p>

         <h3 style="text-align:center;">More Than Iconic Ice Masses</h3>
           <p>To address this problem, we want to change the perception that instead of visiting the park to see the glaciers, they are visiting to explore the remarkable landscapes carved by the glaciers and witness the implications of our actions on the environment so we can address the issue.</p>
           <p>Glacier is already making efforts to increase awareness of the rapidly disappearing glaciers in a variety of ways including an exhibit called “Losing A Legacy.”</p>
           <p>Although this is an important step in changing the conversation about the park, this has generally resulted in a short-term surge of visitors who wish to see the glaciers before they disappear.</p>
           <p>We want to begin refocusing efforts on long-term solutions that don’t imply an expiration of the park’s value to visitors so that the park is prepared for the future by 2030 and can build on this new concept.</p>
