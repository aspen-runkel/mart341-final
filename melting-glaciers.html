       <h3 style="text-align:center;">Glacier's Greatest Marketing Challenge</h3>
       <p>When Glacier National Park was established in 1910, approximately 150 glaciers recorded in 1850 at the end of the Little Ice Age were still present according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Park Service. Due largely to increasing climate temperatures and greenhouse gasses over the last century, there are currently only 25 glaciers remaining under the guideline that a glacier must be approximately 25 acres in size to be considered. With all the media exposure that current and potential visitors are exposed to regarding Glacier’s receding icons, they may get the impression that there is nothing left to see in Glacier National Park. According to the National Parks Service, “scientists predict that glaciers in (the Park) will be completely gone by the year 2030, if not earlier”.  Does Glacier National Park have an expiration date?</p>
       <p>This is important from not only a marketing standpoint but also because it represents a major environmental concern. People have visited the park even before its establishment to view the many glaciers in the area. They represent what the park has been known for and are a key component of its brand. The USGS expresses this same concern saying that, “the loss of glaciers in GNP will have significant consequences for park ecosystems as well as impacting landscape aesthetics valued by park visitors.”  In short, the loss of glaciers affects the flow and temperature of water, which is a critical resource for wildlife, aquatic species, vegetation, and humans.</p>
       <p>With over 2 million visitors annually, the economic impact that disappearing glaciers and the perception that there is nothing left to see could be substantial. According to NPS representative Denise Germann, Glacier National Park generated $179 million in 2013 in the park and surrounding areas.</p>
       <p>Glacier National Park is a traveler’s paradise which is why it is important to elevate its strengths and address it challenges when it comes to marketing. As we have expressed, Glacier has much more to offer than just seeing the glaciers.  Changing the perception that instead of going to see the glaciers they are visiting to see the beautiful landscape formed by glaciers and see first-hand the affect we are having on the environment is important to rebranding Glacier National Park and maintaining its reputation as a noteworthy destination.</p>
