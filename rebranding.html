       <h3 style="text-align:center;">More Than Iconic Ice Masses</h3>
       <p>Despite everything that Glacier has to offer, one of the park’s primary marketing challenges is the spotlight on retreating glaciers. Due largely to increasing climate temperatures and greenhouse gasses over the last century, only 25 of the original 150 glaciers remain, and scientists predict that they will be gone completely by 2030. The fear is that visitors are under the impression that there will be nothing left to see, and they will disappear along with the glaciers. This is important not only from a marketing standpoint but also because it represents a major economic and environmental concern.</p>
       <p>To address this problem, we want to change the perception that instead of visiting the park to see the glaciers, they are visiting to explore the remarkable landscapes carved by the glaciers and witness the implications of our actions on the environment so we can take action.</p>
       <p>Glacier is already making efforts to increase awareness of the rapidly disappearing glaciers, but this has generally resulted in a short-term solution which brings in visitors who wish to see the glaciers before they disappear.  We want to begin refocusing efforts on long-term solutions that don’t imply an expiration of the park’s value to visitors so that the park is prepared for the future by 2030 and can build on this new concept.</p>
       <p>To accomplish this, we must consider the National Park Service’s organizational objective and adjust the marketing objective accordingly. The NPS’s objective is to “preserve the natural and cultural resources and values of the parks for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of all generations.”  We suggest reframing Glacier’s marketing objective to involve a rebranding effort for Glacier and its collaborators that defines Glacier’s core product and value to visitors as a scenic experience and educational tool now and in the future.</p>
       <p>The first key action in this process would be to conduct marketing research to improve our understanding of the marketspace so that we can make more effective and efficient decisions. For instance, Glacier could conduct surveys aimed at discovering why visitors come to the park, where they are coming from, what are their key motives and interests, etc.</p>
       <p>Glacier’s next point of action should be to work with its collaborators to develop a unified plan and message moving forward.  They will work on refocusing their promotional efforts to align with the park’s long-term value to visitor along with creating an educational platform that creates awareness regarding the glaciers without implying expiration of value. Creating a unified message for Glacier and all its collaborators to use will allow this renewed message to reach a larger audience and more effectively transform the perception people have about the park.  Specific applications of this process could include exhibits, information centers, and events that provide interesting learning experiences that help visitors better understand the impact glaciers have had on the landscape and ecosystem, the changes that have occurred, and the opportunities that the park has to offer henceforth.</p>
       <p>A current exhibit that allows visitors to “see” climate change called “Losing A Legacy” is currently displayed in Many Glacier Hotel at the base of the Grinnell Glacier hike.  Run by Lisa McKeon, a Physical Scientist who runs the repeat photography project out of USGS’s Global Change Research Center, these side-by-side comparison photos show the dramatic changes that have occurred over the last century.  This example is visual, educational, and inspires visitors to get involved. We suggest modeling other exhibits or events to also give global warming a face and make climate change a relevant issue while also demonstrating the value of the park.</p>
       <p>The novel of our efforts is that they not only impact the park’s long-term marketability, but they inspire environmental change and economic sustainability.  The loss of glaciers has significant consequences for the park ecosystem and surrounding irrigational communities.  It also impacts aesthetics valued by the over 2 million annual visitors who generate approximately $179 million. A loss of either of these resources is highly detrimental, and our plan considers both of these concerns.</p>
       <p>Glacier National Park is full of opportunity to explore and learn.  Although Glacier’s namesakes are disappearing, the park will always be a scenic and educational experience for travelers of all ages from all corners of the world. Changing the perception that instead of visiting the park to see the glaciers, they are visiting for the scenic and educational experience. This is an important step for Glacier national park to maintain its reputation as a noteworthy destination.</p>
